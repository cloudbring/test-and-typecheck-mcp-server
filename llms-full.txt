# Detailed Guidance for LLMs

Safety:
- Do not execute arbitrary binaries; only spawn configured vitest/tsc.
- Redact secrets and tokens from logs and outputs.

Tools:
- run_tests
  - params: testFiles? (string or array of strings)
  - returns: formatted test results with pass/fail status, duration, and details
- type_check
  - params: files? (string or array of strings) 
  - returns: formatted type errors, warnings, and diagnostic information

Operational Notes:
- Expect deterministic outputs from both tools.
- Large outputs may be truncated for performance.
- Server requires a project directory as command line argument.
- Uses Vitest for test execution and TypeScript compiler for type checking.
- Both tools operate on the specified project directory context.

Rate Limits:
- Prefer no more than 1 concurrent type check per project to avoid CPU contention.
- Test runs are sequential and should complete before starting new operations.
